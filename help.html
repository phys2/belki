<h1>Belki in Five Seconds</h1>

After loading a file, the main graph shows all proteins in a reduced feature
space. The transformation to compute this space can be selected in the toolbar.
All PCA transformations are based on picking two out of the three principal
components found by PCA.

<p>
In the graph, hold the left mouse button to define a region to zoom into or
zoom out using the right mouse button.
</p>

<h2>Markers</h2>

You can use the list of all proteins in the dataset to the left to add markers
to the graph. This works by either selecting them individually in the list,
or by using the filter box above: Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> while typing in the
filter box to add/remove the currently suggested protein as a marker.

<p>
You can conveniently remove present markers by clicking on them in the
graph legend.
</p>

<h2>Protein Cursor</h2>

The red ellipse that follows the mouse in the plot is called <i>cursor</i>.
Use the <kbd>Space</kbd> key or a left mouse button click to lock the cursor to its
current position. Unlock the cursor in the same manner.

<p>
You can find all proteins under the cursor to the left. Click a protein in the
list to look it up in UniProt. Clicking a protein in the graph currently does
nothing.
</p>

<p>The cursor's shape represents a sphere in the reduced feature space. To change
the size of this sphere, use the mouse wheel to change the zoom factor.
